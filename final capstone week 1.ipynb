    "#### Scenario: Let us suppose that a small company (startup) runs in a flat cum office with all basic amenities at Washington, USA. But due to some unavoidalbe circumsatnaces the owner of the flat decided to move in and gave a month time for the company people to vacate their flat. Now, the comapny people are in search for a place similar to this place having facilities of nearby resturants, shops, metro or public transport etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem: The problem infront of the company people is to get a similar place, atleast having 3 rooms, nearby public transport facility, and more importantly rent should be around 10000 USD/month. Also, this time the office owner are looking to open their office in Manhattan.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reusability: This is a common situation for number of low or startup companies. So, this project can be helpful for number of startups.\n",

    "### Data\n",
